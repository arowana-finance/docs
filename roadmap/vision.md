# Vision

Arowana is building a real-world asset (RWA)-based digital financial infrastructure centered around **gold**, one of the most stable and universally trusted physical assets. For thousands of years, gold has served as a fundamental monetary standard, and even today, it remains a reliable store of value for nations, institutions, and individuals alike.

By leveraging blockchain technology to tokenize and operate gold in a transparent and liquid on-chain environment, Arowana opens access to real-world assets that were traditionally difficult for the public to engage with. Based on this vision:


* **AGT (Arowana Gold Token)** serves as a bridge between the physical and digital economies by tokenizing real gold;
* The **ARW ecosystem** establishes a liquidity and rewards structure driven by participant engagement;
* Future **commodity index-based derivatives** will enable seamless entry into a Web3 economy underpinned by real assets.


Arowana is not merely a gold trading platform - it aims to become a next-generation digital financial hub by combining the **credibility of physical assets** with the **scalability of Web3**.
