# Voting Mechanism

The voting mechanism of the Arowana Protocol is designed to achieve decentralized, user centered governance. ARW token holders are empowered to participate directly in major&#x20;protocol decisions. \
All proposals are evaluated and adopted through a fair and transparent&#x20;voting process.
