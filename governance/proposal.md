# Proposal

The proposal process in the Arowana Protocol is designed to empower users to directly&#x20;influence the direction and key parameters of the protocol. This transparent and fair process&#x20;encourages active participation from ARW token holders, enabling community based decision&#x20;making

### 1. Proposal Submission Requirements

* **ARW Token Staking**
  * To submit a proposal, users must stake a minimum amount of    &#x20;ARW tokens.
  * For example, proposers may need to stake at least 1,000 ARW tokens.
  * The exact staking amount will follow specific policies, which will be announced on    &#x20;the official website or social media channels.
* **Proposal Fee**
  * A certain amount of ARW tokens must either be burned or deposited    &#x20;to prevent spam proposals.
  * This fee ensures that proposers participate seriously.    &#x20;The fee structure will also adhere to separate policies
