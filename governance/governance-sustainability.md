# Governance Sustainability

### Long-term sustainability of governance structures

* **Target**: The governance structure of the Arowana Protocol is designed to ensure long-term sustainability
* **Strategy and Mechanism**:
  * It includes a variety of incentive alignment and activation strategies to encourage community participation and maintain sustainable governance.

***

### 1. Adjustment of Governance Incentives

The Arowana Protocol incentivizes active governance participation in its early stages through high ARW token reward rates.\
This approach is critical for ensuring liquidity and fostering community engagement.
However, as the protocol matures, it will be necessary to gradually adjust the reward rates to ensure sustainability.\
These adjustments will be determined through governance votes and tailored to community consensus.

* **Initial Reward Rates**:
  * High reward rates are maintained in the early stages to
    &#x20;encourage participation.
  * This plays a vital role in ensuring liquidity for the protocol and activating the community.
* **Gradual Reduction**:
  * As the protocol grows, reward rates are gradually reduced
    to establish a sustainable structure.
* **Governance Voting**:
  * Adjustments to the reward ratio are determined by community consensus through gove-nance voting..
  * The compensation ratio adjustment may be flexibly changed.

### 2. Community Activation

The Arowana Protocol adopts various strategies to foster active participation and long-term community growth.\
These strategies aim to make governance more accessible and strengthen community cohesion.

* **Regular Community Events**:
  * Initiatives such as AMA sessions,
    &#x20;workshops, and voting campaigns encourage user engagement.
* **Educational Programs**:
  * Educational materials about the governance process
    and protocol functionalities help users understand and participate more
    &#x20;effectively.
* **Feedback Integration**:
  * User feedback is actively collected and incorporated
    &#x20;into governance proposals, driving continuous improvement and development.
* **Community Leadership**:
  * Identifying and empowering community leaders
    &#x20;fosters a natural environment for governance participation-and leadership.

### 3. Governance Diversification-

To enhance diversity and inclusiveness in governance, the Arowana Protocol supports various proposal types and participation methods.\
This approach prevents power concentration among a few users and ensures fair representation of all participants.

* **Varied Proposal Types**:
  * Supporting a wide range of proposals, such as
    &#x20;protocol parameter adjustments, new feature additions, and reward structure
    &#x20;changes, reflects the diverse needs of the community.
* **Improved Participation Methods**:
  * Introducing advanced voting mechanisms,
    &#x20;such as ranked-choice voting or score voting, allows users to express their
    &#x20;preferences more precisely.
* **Enhanced Voting Mechanisms**:
  * Continual improvement of voting mechanisms,
    &#x20;including strategies to prevent manipulation by a minority and to increase voter
    &#x20;turnout.
* **Strengthened Decentralization**:
  * Reinforcing decentralization ensures fair
    participation in decision-making, aligning with the protocol s goal of achieving
    &#x20;full decentralization.

The governance of the Arowana Protocol ensures participation and transparency through an appropriate reward system and community activation strategy for sustainable growth, and ensures that all users' opinions are fairly reflected through the diversification of governance.
