# Voting Power

Voting power within the Arowana Protocol is proportional to the amount of ARW tokens held by\
each user. This means that users holding more ARW tokens have a greater influence on voting\
outcomes. Specifically, each ARW token represents one vote, and the total number of ARW\
tokens held by a user determines their voting weight.
