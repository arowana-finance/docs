# Protocol Architecture

### Arbitrum Blockchain

Arbitrum is a leading L2 rollup chain that maximizes the scalability and compatibility of Ethereum.\
In particular, by utilizing Optimistic Rollup, it ensures fast processing and low fees while maintaining stable connections with Ethereum Mainnet.\
Arbitrum is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine EVM, meaning that existing Ethereum smart contracts and DApps can be migrated as-is, which significantly lowers the technical barrier for developers and users alike.\
Through this, Arowana Protocol can achieve hig- scalability, low fees, and Ethereum-based security and compatibility meeting all three of the key requirements.\
In particular, Arbitrum Nitro technology significantly improves transaction throughput and operational efficiency, offering users an enhanced experience.\
Arowana aims to provide core features such as AGT issuance, exchange, liquidity supply, lending, staking, and fund investment fully on-chain through Arbitrum, ensuring both scalability and accessibility across its ecosystem.

### External Integration Strategy

In the early stages, rather than building its own DEX or lending platform, Arowana Protocol plans
to secure liquidity through integration with reputable DEXs within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\
By leveraging leading DEX platforms like Trader Joe, which provide strong reputation and deep liquidity within Arbitrum, as well as Uniswap v3, Balancer, and Curve,\
Arowana ensures a stable and secure trading experience for both institutions and individual users, backed by thoroughly audited smart contracts.\
In addition, Arowana is actively considering integration with token centric DEXs like Camelot, which has strong community based influence within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\
Partnerships with such DEXs will enhance liquidity and help establish Arowana as a key player in the ecosystem.\
Through this network of DEX integrations, users will be able to freely trade AGT and ARW tokens.\
Moreover, users can stake AGT in liquidity pools to earn additional returns naturally linking this function to investment into RWA based products.\
All of this is underpinned by secure smart contracts and risk managed mechanisms, providing users with a reliable DeFi experience.

The platform's architecture operates in 4 layers:

1. **Origination Layer**
2. **Tokenization Layer**
3. **DeFi Layer**
4. **Fund Layer**
