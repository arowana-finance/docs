# ARW Token Migration

::: warning
ARW Token migration page from Ethereum to Arbitrum will open soon
:::

To resolve limitations in the existing contract and enhance liquidity, we’ve decided to proceed with a token migration that will better support the long-term growth of the Arowana ecosystem.

We identified critical issues in the previous contract and have deployed a new contract to address them.

This migration was essential in order to remove the mint function and ensure greater transparency and security for all holders.
