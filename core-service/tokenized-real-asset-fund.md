# Tokenized Real Asset Fund

### RWA Tokenization

Arowana Protocol tokenizes a wide range of RWAs, including gold, by converting them into
\
digital assets on the blockch-in. Through this process, the protocol aims to revolutionize asset
\
ownership and liquidity. Real-world assets are securely stored by SPCs or certified custodians,
\
and corresponding digital rights are issued in the form of tokens like AGT or as NFTs.

Beyond individual asset tokenization, Arowana creates fund pools based on tokenized RWAs.

These funds allow users to diversify their investments across various physical assets. In
&#x20;particular, users who have unlocked liquidity via the Lending Protocol can easily reinvest their
&#x20;assets into these products
