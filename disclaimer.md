### No Guarantee of Market Liquidity

Digital asset markets vary widely in terms of liquidity. \
Digital assets are not currencies issued by central banks or national, supranational, or quasi-national organizations, nor are they backed by any physical assets or other credit. \
As such, this document does not guarantee the existence of an active market for trading or transacting digital assets, their derivatives, or associated products.

### No Guarantee of Price Stability

The value of digital assets is highly volatile and can change rapidly. \
There is no guarantee that the market price of digital assets will not fall below their original purchase price, nor that the purchase price will reflect the market price of the assets once they become tradable on cryptocurrency exchanges or markets. \
You are advised to closely monitor your positions and holdings and to be aware of the potential impact of sudden fluctuations in market activity.

### Legal and Regulatory Changes

The regulatory status of digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or uncertain in many jurisdictions. \
It is difficult to predict how regulators may apply existing regulations to digital assets, blockchain technology, and their applications. As such, it cannot be guaranteed that the transfer of digital assets will be recognized under applicable laws at a national or international level. \
This document accepts no liability for losses or other issues arising from changes in laws or regulations related to digital assets.
