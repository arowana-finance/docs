### 3. ARW Value Stabilization Mechanisms

ARW is designed to be the center of an economic circulation structure, not just a simple reward. To this end, the following circulation stabilization mechanisms are applied:

* **ARW Burn Policy**
  * A portion of platform fees collected in ARW will be regularly burned
  * Burn volume may adjust dynamically based on platform activity
* **Liquidity Mining Incentives**
  * Inducing price stability by paying ARW rewards to early liquidity providers
  * Review of compensation reinforcement structure according to liquidity maintenance period
* **Staking Reward System**
  * Staking rewards for ARW or AGT help reduce short-term circulation
  * Designed to encourage long-term engagement, it manages supply and increases demand.
