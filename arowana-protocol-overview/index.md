# Arowana Protocol Overview

**Arowana Protocol** is a gold-based Real World Asset (RWA) platform that tokenizes physical assets starting with gold on the blockchain, enabling anyone to trade them easily and securely. Its ultimate goal is to build a decentralized financial infrastructure that encompasses asset liquidity, verification, trading, and the issuance of derivative products.

### 1. The Necessity of a Gold-Based RWA Protocol

* **Gold as a Safe-Haven Asset**
  * Gold has long been recognized as a proven store of value, especially in times of economic uncertainty. However, due to the costs and complexities of physical storage and trade, it remains difficult for individual investors to access directly.
* **Arowana's Solution**
  * Arowana Protocol solves this by **tokenizing gold into a digital form** and enabling its use on the blockchain-for trading, holding, and integrating into derivative products. This unlocks gold’s value in a more accessible and efficient way for global users.

### 2. Tokenization and Asset Liquidity

* **Gold Tokenization Protocol**
  * Arowana Protocol begins as a **“Gold Tokenization Protocol.”**
  * It secures physical gold reserves and proves their backing on-chain through transparent and verifiable means, issuing digital tokens that correspond 1:1 to the underlying gold.
* **Asset Liquidity Protocol**
  * Once issued, the gold-backed tokens can be deployed across various financial services such as **lending, staking, and collateralization.**
  * By connecting with multiple DeFi applications, these tokens enhance liquidity throughout the decentralized finance ecosystem.

### 3. Roadmap and Vision

* **From Tokenization to Reinvestment**
  * Arowana’s vision extends beyond gold token issuance. The project aims to evolve into a **comprehensive platform for digitizing real-world assets.**
  * Starting with gold, it will expand to commodities, real estate, and bonds-creating a diverse pool of tokenized assets for global investors to reinvest in through a secure, transparent, and efficient system.
* **Driving Financial Innovation**
  * Through this roadmap-**gold tokenization → asset liquidity → reinvestment of liquid assets**-Arowana Protocol will become a driving force of innovation in the global financial markets.
  * Its mission is to democratize access to physical assets, simplify transaction processes, and build a complete ecosystem where users can actively utilize and reinvest their tokenized holdings.
