# Features of the Protocol

Arowana Protocol offers a stable and innovative financial ecosystem by tokenizing physical assets starting with gold and providing various decentralized finance (DeFi) services. The core features of the protocol are as follows:

***

### 1. Arowana Swap

* **Functionality**
  * Arowana Swap is a decentralized exchange within the ecosystem that allows users to trade digital assets such as **AGT**, **USDT**, and **ARW.**
  * Instead of using an order book, users exchange assets through a liquidity pool model.
* **Liquidity Provider Incentives**
  * Liquidity providers earn revenue through trading fees and ARW token rewards.
* **Market Stability**
  * The protocol maintains market stability by supporting multiple trading pairs and ensuring sufficient liquidity.

### 2. AGT Mint / Redeem

* **AGT Overview**
  * **AGT** is a token that reflects the value of **1 gram of physical gold**.
  * Users can mint or redeem AGT based on their desired quantity.
* **Minting**
  * Users can mint AGT by providing physical gold or stable assets like USDT.
  * Arowana purchases and securely stores the equivalent amount of physical gold.
* **Redemption**
  * When redeeming AGT, Arowana sells the corresponding physical gold and returns the original asset to the user.
